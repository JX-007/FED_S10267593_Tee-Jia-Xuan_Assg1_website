FED Assignment 1 - GameRadar+ Website Revamp
Project Description: For this project, I have taken pages out of GameRadar+'s website that I think the interface can be improved and created pages that I think was lacking from its current state. This is to make it more aesthetically pleasing and include functions that are missing for a better user experience.

Design Process: While working on my previous game website, I felt that it was too out of reach, but I still wanted to keep it game related. So I decided to improve websites that showcase games much like popular show websites that provide information about movies or series, but with games. While researching, I stumbled onto GameRadar+. A website that provides gaming information, tips and news in the form of articles. As I looked through it, I was not satisfied by their current website layout and the lack of a sign in/ log in page gave me the idea to focus on this website. As this website is for people who are interested in games, mostly teenagers and adults, I wanted to make this website more reactive to interactions so that it can capture the attention of these target users in a more pointed manner. Other than reorganising the layout and interactivity, I also wanted to create the pages missing for logging in and creating an account.

Features
- Dropdown bar & Hamburger button - Available on mobile to save space instead of using a navigation bar. There was an implementation of this feature on the actual GameRadar+ (mobile screen) but I felt that the animation for it (the hamburger icon flips from horizontal to vertical when active) was silly and the way that it was organised was unsatisfactory and odd looking.

- Login & Sign Up page - Also known as Subscribe in the actual page, is not available for unknown reasons. Therefore, I made one in my snippet of a website referencing them. I kept the colours of their branding in mind while creating this two pages.

- Footer - Rather than including their social links right at the navgation bar as in the actual website, I think it would've been more tasteful to leave it in the footer. Hence why I reogranised their footer.

Future Features
- A more organised contact us page

Testing Process:
Log In form:
Go to the "Log In" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Form shrinks when the screen size has become narrower.

Sign Up form:
Go to the "Sign Up" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to input invalid values for email and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to input different password into Confirm password to verify that an error alert message about the mismatching passwords appears
Form shrinks when the screen size has become narrower.
